# animatronic cat ears

Each ear (Left and Right) has 2 servos, Top and Bottom.  Bottom rotates in horizontal plane, Top rotates in vertical.  

Aim is to use 2 buttons to tell ears to carry out pre-set routines.  A particular button press would make the ears to a particular routine.  Eventually would like about 4 routines, so buttons would need to be multifunctional, e.g. with double-press or long-press alternatives.  Extension project may be to add joystick control.  


## Current state:

Currently the sketch catears.ino does only 2 things: 
- on button 1 press, left ear servos do a routine
- on button 2 press, right ear servos do a routine

Button 2 press doesn't work at the moment.
